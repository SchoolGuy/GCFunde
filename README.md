The following functions are planned:
- Working with local gpx data
- Working with geocaching.com Geocaches (and storing them locally)
- Map displaying of Geocaches
- Filtering Caches (locallay and on geocaching.com)
- Maybe: A part of the app should implement as many useful cryptographic functions and alphabets as possible
