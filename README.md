# GCFunde

This project should be developed by myself and and everyone who would like to participate (requests pls to: matrixfueller@gmail.com).

The following functions are planned:
- Working with local gpx data
- Working with geocaching.com Caches (and storing them locally)
- Map integration
- Filtering Caches (locallay and geocaching.com)
- Maybe: A part should implement as many useful cryptographic functions and alphabets as possible
